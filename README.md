# STECH-Capstone Project: Pyrate

by R. G. Blaine

**Pyrate** is a roguelike game developed using Python v2.7.8 (32-bit), Pygame, and the Doryen library (libtcod).

# Synopsis

"Pyrate" is an archaic spelling of the word "pirate." (Pirates being known rogues and scalliwags.)  It is also a play on words of "Python."

The game provides a GUI that allows the user to take on the role of a heroic frog trapped in a dungeon and fighting enemies such as crabs, ravens, and pythons in an attempt to escape said dungeon.

The game automatically saves the players progress when the player exits the game and, upon launching the game, allows the player to load a previously saved game or start anew.  In the spirit of roguelikes, however, the player has but one life.  Upon dying (or winning the game), the player's save file is erased.  When the player dies, a legacy text file is generated that contains all of the in-game messages generated during the game.

In lieu of using an inheritance scheme for objects, I opted to use a component scheme.  The main type of in-game object is called an "actor" and represents any object in the game that can move and/or interact in the game.  Component objects are created and attached to the actor object to denote different types of objects.  For example, creature components add the ability to attack, take damage, and "die."  Item commponents allow the actor object to be "used" in order to activate various abilities.  When "attaching" a component to the actor object, the actor is instructed that the component belongs to it the component is instructed that it belongs to the actor.

# Installation

As it stands, installation of the game requires that Python v2.7.8 (32-bit) as well as the pygame and libtcodpy modules be installed in the Python site packages directory. (These modules are included in the site-packages.zip file.)  To run the program, open it in Idle or another IDE and run it from there.

# Code Example

The actor object is the primary object in the game. The creature component was, by far, the most complicated one.  When an actor object is constructed, an optional creature argument is passed (defaulting to None) and attached to the actor object.

Actor Object:

```python
class objActor:

	'''
	any game element that can move/interact with other elements
	'''

	global LOS_MAP

# Motivation

My motivation for this project stems from my love of programming and of games. The orginal PC game, Rogue, was a huge inspiration for me to become a programmer.

# API Reference

The title and credits screen includes ui buttons to continue a saved game, start a new game, quit the game, and to open the options sub-menu.

![alt text](https://github.com/Blaine-Rob5000/STECH-Capstone/blob/Pyrate/TitleScreen.PNG "Title Screen")

The options sub-menu has sliders to control the volume of game sound effects and music and a button to save these preferences to a file. (Saved preferences are automatically loaded when the game is run.)

![alt text](https://github.com/Blaine-Rob5000/STECH-Capstone/blob/Pyrate/OptionsMenu.PNG "Options Menu")

Here is a screenshot of actual gameplay.  The player (a frog) is near the center of the screen.  Map tiles and objects in the player's visible radius (8 tiles, with line of sight blocked by walls) are displayed in the "lighted" area.  Explored map tiles that are not visible are shaded darker.  On the right side of the screen, from the top down, are displayed:

* The player's current / maximum health

* The player's level, and current xp / xp needed to reach the next level

* The level of the dungeon map that the player is currently exploring

* A mini-map that shows explored tiles (and highlights currently visible tiles)

* A list of recent in-game messages

![alt text](https://github.com/Blaine-Rob5000/STECH-Capstone/blob/Pyrate/GameScreen.PNG "Game Screen")

The Help menu lists the in-game commands and gives some advice on playing the game.

![alt text](https://github.com/Blaine-Rob5000/STECH-Capstone/blob/Pyrate/HelpMenu.PNG "Help Menu")

The inventory menu lists all of the items the player is currently carrying.  Equipped items have the equipment slot indicated next to them.  (Each slot - main hand, off hand, and neck - can hold only one item.)

![alt text](https://github.com/Blaine-Rob5000/STECH-Capstone/blob/Pyrate/InventoryMenu.PNG "Inventory Menu")

The legacy text file (generated when the player dies or wins the game) lists all of the in-game messages the player recieved.

# Tests

Testing the game is simply a matter of playing it.  It is possible that a few lingering bugs remain to be squashed, but I have tested it rather thoroughly and believe the code to be sound and functioning as intended.  The constants file contains several variables that can be used to tweak gameplay and a flag to signal certain debug messages to print during gameplay.
