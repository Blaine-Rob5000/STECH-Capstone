# STECH-Capstone Project: Pyrate

by R. G. Blaine

**Pyrate** is a roguelike game developed using Python v2.7.8, Pygame, and the Doryen library (libtcod).

# Synopsis

"Pyrate" is an archaic spelling of the word "pirate." (Pirates being known rogues and scalliwags.)  It is also a play on words of "Python."

The game provides a GUI that allows the user to take on the role of a heroic frog trapped in a dungeon and fighting enemies such as crabs, ravens, and pythons in an attempt to escape said dungeon.

The game automatically saves the players progress when the player exits the game and, upon launching the game, allows the player to load a previously saved game or start anew.  In the spirit of roguelikes, however, the player has but one life.  Upon dying (or winning the game), the player's save file is erased.  When the player dies, a legacy text file is generated that contains all of the in-game messages generated during the game.
